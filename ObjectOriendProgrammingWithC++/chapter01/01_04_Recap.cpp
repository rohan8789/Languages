// c++ ---- initially called c with classes
// class ----- extension to structures in C
// structures had limitations
//   members were public
// no methods
//classes means structures + more
//classes have mehtods and properties
//clases can make few members as private and public
//structures in c++ are typedefed
//You can declare objects along with class decleration

           class employee{
        //        //class definition
        }Rohan, sameer, rishu;
        */
//Rohan.Salary = 45k dont make any sense if the salary is private

//All function inside the class is by default inline hence, 
//it is not advisable to define it inside the class

/* 
1. C is prodedural and cpp is object oriented
2. struct vs classes
3. classes====> updated ver of structure
