/*
POLYMORPHISM------> One Name Multiple Forms
Polymorphism is a base class pointer that can refer to variety of object.
Polymorphism is an ability of an object to act differently to the same interface

    eg:- Function Overloading
         Operators Overloading
         Virtual Functions

POLYMORPHISM in cpp------> Ability of cpp Objects to take many forms 
1. Compile TIme Polymorphism
   1.1. Function Overloading
   1.2 Operator Overloading

2. Run Time Polymorphism
   2.1. Virtual Function

/*
1. Compile Time Polymorphism: 
-> also called early binding 
-> also called static Polymorphism

   Compile time polymorphism is an static or early binding polymorphism which selects right function 
   during compile time by looking at name and address of the function call. it replaces the call within 
   machine language instruction.

  #Early binding takes place bydefault.
  #Achieved by method overloading and Operator overloading




2. RunTime Polymorphism:- 
->also called late binding
->also called dynamic polymorphism
   which function definition is going to be called is decided on RunTime of the program
